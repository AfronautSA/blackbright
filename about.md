# 1. About Us

1st January 2018, when most people were celebrating there New Years day, this was our day of reckoning and the birth of what we call Blackbright. Our aim is to bring a shift of mindset to the South African people (young and old).

To achieve this we combined our expertise on motivational speaking and distilled it into Blackbright.

We form part of the youth of South Africa and have seen the challenges that come with just living day by day in this country let alone running a business as a youth. We have seen the broken mindset that has set back the black community and we doing as much as possible to change that.
