> Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success - Napoleon Hill.

One of the hardest lessons I had to learn in my pursuit for success is patience. Learning that you won't be a millionaire for a half a decade or more is a difficult pill to swallow, especially if you that's all you ever wanted.

One of my go to procrastination tools was going on Instagram and envying people who lived a life i wished for. You've seen them before: brand new Mercedes Benz, a diamond encrusted Rolex, a house in the hills and the perfect holiday destinations with perfect relationships. How i wished!

So naturally i wanted to live the way they live, eat what they eat and do what they do. So, instead of pursuing something i believed in, i chased what i thought was "The perfect life". I tried a bunch of get rich quick schemes and watched tons of YouTube videos on "How to make $10000" fast.

Most of the videos are bullshit and the ones that aren't have on catch: _Its never, ever, ever fast._
We (myself included) as millennials have accustomed to thinking that success is something we accomplish over night. The plain and simple truth: it just isn't.

Those Instagram success stories i envied I've come to respect. They have been on the grind before me, they worked harder, played less and most of they were patient in the process.

Whether you sit and dream or get up and work the time will pass.
