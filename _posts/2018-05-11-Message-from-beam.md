> We live in contrast world, different people with different energies. We search for what gives us meaning, it's how we separate ourselves from those not in the same light as us. think about it who wants to be stuck with people who don't share the same vision as you. - Tey Samuelson

And to think all of this was few seconds from never happening. Gosh the universe has its own ways of showing one hell and appreciation, and that contrast is the foundation of our company. Welcome to blackbright. Thank you for joining our unorthodox, crazy, motivational blog.

The blog is an informative, educative and motivating blog where we discuss diverse issues that affect us as millennials - in a rather unorthodox manner.

See, we are South African and have seen the struggle of self confidence with our people. Some not having much discipline or much structures in there lives. Hence we really saw the need to write these articles which will get you motivated and understand your worth, goals and all round wellbeing.

The blog posts have different categories, namely:

* AD - Advice columns. Written by various blackbright authors
* Ht- How To posts, mostly written by Tey Samuelson and Rea Mokwa. Mostly these are steps to get you into acting up on your goals.
* lastly, Mg - Messages. These are from the blackbright team (beam). General Stuff.

We will always appreciate your feedback on the blog if you have any comments or suggestions we would love to hear them. We promise to bring the best content that will interest, inform, educate and motivate you always.

Thanks
