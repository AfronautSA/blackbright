# Welcome to Blackbright

> We live in contrast, it's how we separate ourselves from those not in the same light as us.
*Samuelson*

And to think this was few seconds from never happening, wow the universe has its own ways of showing one hell and appreciation. Welcome to black bright. Thank you for joining our crazy blog.

The blog is an informative, educative and motivating blog where we discuss diverse issues that affect us as millennials - in a rather unorthodox manner.

We will always appreciate your feedback on the blog if you have any comments or suggestions we would love to hear them. We promise to bring the best content that will interest, inform, educate and motivate you always.

Thanks
