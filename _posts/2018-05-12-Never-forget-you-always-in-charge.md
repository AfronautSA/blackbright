# Never forget, you always in charge


>“You are 100fucking% in charge of your life, stop fucking bitching” – Gary Vaynerchuk 


As a child I always used to ask myself why my mother never takes me to school with a car like the other children’s parents do or how I never get the same things others do. I could go on and on about how much I questioned myself on why we could never have or do the things other people do.


Don’t misunderstand me, I love my mother dearly, she did the best she could with what she had.  That’s not why I mentioned that. You see, as I grew up I realised I could be whatever I wanted to be. Naturally **I wanted to be rich!** That way I could buy myself that PlayStation and be like the other children. Sounds like something you said as a child?


As time went by we all *“grew up”* and started settling for less. Our ambitions of owning seven different coloured Lamborghini’s faded away. Now we okay with anything. maybe seven cars are abit excessive but the possibily of obtaining them is ever present in my mind.


Now that I have it ‘Figured out’ and by some miracle I’m fortunate to have my grandmother who supports my dreams and allowed me to take a shot at glory. 


Yes our situations aren’t the same and it’s not easy to make dreams a reality but don’t you want to live the life you always imagined? Free from worry and regret? Guess what? **You** in charge of your life. Change it.


Till next time
