# Never forget, you always in charge


>“You are 100fucking% in charge of your life, stop fucking bitching” – Gary Vaynerchuk 


As a child I always used to ask myself why my mother would never takes me to school with a car like the other children’s parents do or how I never get the same things others do. I could go on and on about how much I would questioned myself on why we could never have or do the things other people do.


Not to get myself misunderstood, I love my mother dearly. She did the best she could with the little she had.  That’s not why I mentioned that. You see, as I grew up I realized I can be whatever I wanted to be. Naturally **I wanted to be rich!** That way I could buy myself that PlayStation, to be in par as the other children. to share those experiences with them. Sounds like something you might have said as a child too right?


As time went by we all *“grew up”* and started settling for less. Our ambitions of owning seven different colored Lamborghini’s faded away. Now we okay with anything. maybe seven cars are a bit excessive but the possibly of obtaining them is ever present in my mind.


Now that I have it ‘Figured out’ and by some miracle I’m fortunate to have my grandmother who supports my dreams and allowed me to take a shot at glory. 


Yes our situations aren’t the same and it’s not easy to make dreams a reality but don’t you want to live the life you always imagined? Free from worry and regret? Guess what? **You in charge of your life. Change it.**
