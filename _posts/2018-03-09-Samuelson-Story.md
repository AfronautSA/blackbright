How can a stocky lad, average height and with a somewhat great mind play small all his life? Its quite simple, I lacked the confidence I now have. 

Until most recently I had a life without purpose, to put it frankly. A college graduate without a job, a cent to his name and battling with depression. 
Like every other youth in South Africa facing a similar situation, I blamed it on everyone else but never looked at myself as the problem. So what changed?
Here are three significant amendments that could bring about the same changes in your life.

### 1. READ, READ, READ!

The route of all problems starts with lack of understanding, innovative thinking, and awareness.
South Africa has a reading crisis. How many of us read a minimum of 10 books a year? How many of those books give actual value to your current life?

Honestly, books (self-help books) are timeless guides to a better life, better health, and mindset.  And the books I recommend for you to read starting out are:

* Your One Word - Evan Carmicheal
* Rich20Something - Daniel DiPiazza
* Broke Millennial - Erin Lowry
* The Millionaire Next Door - William Danko

These are some of the great books I have read and have changed my perspective on things.
