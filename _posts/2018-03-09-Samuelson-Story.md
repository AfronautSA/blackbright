How can a stocky lad, average height and with a somewhat great mind play small all his life? Its quite simple, I lacked the confidence I now have. 

Until most recently I had a life without purpose, to put it frankly. A college graduate without a job, a cent to his name and battling with depression. 
Like every other youth in South Africa facing a similar situation, I blamed it on everyone else but never looked at myself as the problem. So what changed?
Here are two significant amendments that could bring about the same changes in your life.

### 1. READ, READ, READ!

The route of all problems starts with lack of understanding, innovative thinking, and awareness.
South Africa has a reading crisis. How many of us read a minimum of 10 books a year? How many of those books give actual value to your current life?

Honestly, books (self-help books) are timeless guides to a better life, better health, and mindset.  And the books I recommend for you to read starting out are:

* Your One Word - Evan Carmicheal
* Rich20Something - Daniel DiPiazza
* Broke Millennial - Erin Lowry
* The Millionaire Next Door - William Danko

These are some of the great books I have read and have changed my perspective on things, immensely. 

### 2. Plant (cultivate)

So whether you have aspirations of being a millionaire, philosophy guru, there's a book for every lives problem. You just have to pick up one and start making reading a habit.

## 2. Plant(cultivate)

No, I'm not kidding. 
To know whether you can commit to a goal, or make relationships, businesses grow; a great place is to plant flowers. 

Firstly it enables one to learn to commit to goals.  Secondly,  your input will influence your output.

Think about? How many of your dreams have you started and not nurtured? How many promises have you kept? Are you at the gym, burning that fat you said you would?

So start small, plant. If it dies, it would be a reflection if your life. Repeat the process until you know how to cultivate.

With all that said, it would be up to you to do the necessary changes. I can attest to there great work. 
I now want to leave a dent in this world, and as you read this post know I have archived one of the many goals I have set out for myself.

Goodluck as you embark on your journey.
