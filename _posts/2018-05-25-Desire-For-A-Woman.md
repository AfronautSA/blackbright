> Ambition is the path to success. Persistence is the vehicle you arrive in. - Bill Bradley

_Ah, persistence. The building blocks of a great courtship._ Fella's have you ever wanted a girl who wanted you as well, but she made it near impossible for you to get her?

We all familiar with the push and pull dance we have with the opposite sex. The way she signals she's into you but says she doesn't want you. Her efforts of resisting your charm. Creating a challenge for you, testing your worthiness for her.

Her mixed signals are the worst of anything you've experienced. On some days she doesn't reply to texts and when she does she's very vague. Other days she's extremely flirty and accepting of your efforts to _woo_ her away.

Then the big moment arrives! After days, sometimes even weeks of on and off you hit a slam dunk! BOOM! You get to do the deed! Wasn't it just lovely? The way she created a challenge, the way she made you learn more about yourself? Weren't you just proud of how confident you grew in the pursuit of this beautiful girl? Weren't you proud of the way your PERSISTENCE scored your prize?

Through all those challenges she threw at you, no matter how tough they were you prevailed. If you could remain persistent in your efforts for a women I'm damn certain you could do the same for your dreams.

You loved her body, the way she smiles and her elegant walk right? Well start loving the dream of living the desired life of winners, love the way it will feel when you retire your parents or buy them a car they never dreamed of.
