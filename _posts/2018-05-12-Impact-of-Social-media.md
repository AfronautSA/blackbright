# Social Media, a force to be reckoned with.

>“If you don’t adjust to the reality of the situation you will
be completely left behind” – Gary Vaynerchuk


A few years ago social media was a mere pass time. I used to
spend time socializing with my friends on Mxit and Facebook. Back then social media was nothing but a pass time for children who didn’t want to do homework. Little did i know i'm going to build a business on social media.


Today social media is the place to be. Platforms like Instagram
have allowed models, musicians, fitness fanatics and even graphic designers to break out. Social media isn’t a phase anymore, it’s an era. It has made it much easier for those aspiring to be somebody to make it.


Before I move any further don’t think for a second that posting a picture on Facebook will make you an overnight success. It takes planning and strategizing. Watching meme videos and
envying people with beautiful bodies and cars isn’t the same thing. 


With that being said, understand that media is changing, we
no longer watch television as much as we used to. Your attention is moving towards your cell phone. You now get your latest news updates from Twitter not the prime time news. The first thing you do when you wake up is check your phone. When you experiencing a problem the first thing you do is google a solution.


If you an aspiring, entrepreneur, musician, blogger, model,
look I could on and on but anyone who wants to be anything in the world could benefit from social media. Think it’s expensive? Billboards cost thousands of dollars.
Yes, they effective and reach thousands of people. However the same effect can be had with a Facebook post that could reach up to fifty thousand people with just five dollars. 


It’s not just aspiring individuals capitalizing on the opportunity.
Large corporations like Nike, Adidas, Woolworths and BMW take advantage of how grossly undervalued social media is being taken. 


If you taking advantage of this current opportunity you** WILL**
regret it. If you liked the article and would like to know more about how to actually get to doing then you’ll love what we have in store for you next week.
