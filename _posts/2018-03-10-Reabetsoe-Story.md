title: Reabetsoe's Story
---
My name is Reabetsoe. I’m a trader, blogger, graphic designer and co-founder at blackbright. I’m a regular millennial who just so happened to follow their dreams and I want YOU to do the same.
This is my story. I’ve always been different. I never liked the same things people around me do. I never wanted a job or dreamt of being normal. The childhood dream of driving a Lamborghini in New York (now I want to drive it in Dubai) has never changed. For the longest of times, I’ve never realized that me being different is actually a blessing.

 I didn’t need to fit in or look a certain way. There was no need for me to strive for a vrrr phaa (Slang for the infamous Volkswagen) or dream of moving to Midrand. Don’t get me wrong, there’s no fault in wanting such things - in fact, I support anyone who goes out and gets what they want. However, I don’t like dreaming anymore. That’s for the 6 hours of sleep I get. The other 18 hours is for making dreams a reality.

That pretty much sums me up. My job here at blackbright is to get you thinking about making your dreams real, to get you to live the way you desire even if that dream means being a slay queen or a President and do not conform to the standards society has set.  I want you to realize that anything is possible. Sounds like a typical motivational article? Oh, I forgot to mention that I’m a high school dropout and everything I learned, came from the internet. Something we all have access too.
