> Black people we have so much unlearning to do - Boitumelo
Thulo

About a month or two ago i saw this tweet by a famous actress and television presenter (and crush) Boitumelo Thulo. Now it had me thinking about what we actually need to unlearn as black people. 
It would take me six articles to write everything we need to unlearn so i diced it down to just four points. These four are probably the stepping stones to our growth as a people.

1. Always blaming others

That's by far the biggest problem we have. We never take responsibility for anything. We always blaming people. "It's the governments fault", "South Africa doesn't have opportunities", "They don't care about us" of course 'they' don't care about you! You don't care about you!

The problem with blaming others is that you giving away your power to them. You become a bum. You never in charge. An example of this would be a student who never studies, always comes late to class hardly puts in any work and then blames the teacher for a fate he/she designed. What he/she doesn't realise is that if they actually opened a book, listened in class, got there on time that maybe things would work out better for them.

2. Lack of believe in a pursuit of a passion

By far the biggest problem we have! We never believe!

Friend 1  "I'm thinking of pursuing this music thing full time"
Friend 2 "(laughs loudly) so you think you Black Coffee now?"

We need to learn to support each other fully. I don't mean fake support and gossip about how silly you think it is. I mean really and truly support and believe. How do we grow as a people when all we do to each other is destroy each others dreams? You see a guy from your neighbourhood started a started selling muffins. You laugh at him for walking around with a large bucket of muffins.

What you don't know is that guy is hard working and persistent and in a couple of years that guy will be a millionaire. Start supporting these hustlers.

3. Focusing on other peoples business

For Christ sake focus on your shit! If you weren't so worried about how Felicia got pregnant with twins or how Tshepo thinks his better than you now that he has a job maybe you'd have one! 

Focus on you. Focus on building wealth, focus on your health, focus on your family, just do you. Use your investigative skills to source books so you can better yourself not to know who's Felicia's baby daddy. 

4. Watching so much television

Garbage! We always watching shit! We more loyal to Empire than we are to our goals. We'd rather skip a shower than miss a episode of Date My Family.
Look I'm not saying everything on television is bad, there is some valuable information on there like the business channel which i bet most of don't know exist.
We as black people never seek out knowledge we always looking for entertainment. 
Lets start reading, lets invest time into acquiring knowledge, feeding our brains with hearty information not the junk we consume. 

Let's start growing black people, let's change the world, let's be the best we can be. Unlearn the bullshit.
