title: Being broke has become a choice in 2018

> Money is a necessary topic, but we tippy toe around it...

Yes, I said it! Being broke is a choice. I’ve learned this by waking up today and realizing that the first quarter of the year is over. All my bs about “dream big” and "dreams come to those who wait" fell deep in the ocean when a pipe burst. I know what you thinking: “pipes burst all the time just call a plumber or fix it yourself brat”. The truth is – like many millennials I’m not equipped to deal with such problems. Call me if you need a movie or want to install software on your pc okay?

Of course, like a frantic lunatic, I called upon the help of neighbours. By neighbours, I mean the neighbourhood. I live in a place where one person's problem is everyone's problem (unless it's financial). After thirty minutes of chaotic requests for a T-shirt, plastic, spanners, and pieces of hosepipes it stopped. Mr. MacGyver and troops did it! Mr. MacGyver is the name I give anyone who has 'do it yourself' expertise. His the guy you call when you locked your keys in your car or house. His troops are nosey neighbours who like a scandal and are just there to glamourize the situation.  They finally found a way to stop the ice age sequel.

Mr MacGyver and cadets leave what felt like the Nile River and proceed home. My sister and I sweep out all the water while the housekeeper tends to my bedridden grandmother. Truth be told, in the right set of conditions I would probably flood the old box called home. Reality is: this is not the perfect picture I have in my head with me in a Lamborghini while my grandmother and sister get chauffeured to suburbia in a Maybach. I spend my days watching series and wasting time while my life crumbles before me. All my grandmothers’ pension money and my younger sisters grant money goes to the little salary the help gets.
This noble attempt by my grandmother is to alleviate any household responsibility and allow us to make the best of our situation.
None of is important. This sad story about my life is not my point. All of this doesn’t matter. When push comes to shove dreams don’t pay the bills, MONEY does. With the ability to do anything I want I, for the longest of times, chose binge-watching series and procrastinating. I could have learned an Udemy course online or took surveys or even start working on my dream! A dream which I have a ton of tools to make a reality.

I know, I know this sounds like some cliché rags to riches rubbish but you in luck! I’m still broke. The toilet still doesn’t work and I haven’t struck gold in anything. The point is this, I’ve taken action. I finally opened the first of many trading books and Udemy courses. I finally slept early and woke up earlier. I finally started documenting my progress and actually got to doing instead of making excuses.
In all honesty, I’m scared. I don’t know where the tougher road leads to. I don’t know when I’ll start making money. I don’t know when I can get my grandmother the care she deserves. However, one thing is certain: from here on out I’m putting in a hundred percent effort and I know it will work. If Cassper Nyovest could make it while homeless I’m sure I’ll be good with a home and housekeeper.
