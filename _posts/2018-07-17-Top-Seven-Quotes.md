But like any other entrepreneur, he's had his own fair share of struggles: dyslexia, being an unemployed graduate and dropping out of varsity (the second time around). But like any other story of relentless human, he defied the odds against him and the next list of quotes summarize the state of mind he's in. He had to change his views on the world and by all mean try to empower others to do the same.

1. "Mirrors don't lie. Frankly mirrors reflect our thoughts. Either you love what you see or conclude you need to change."
2. "Success, well my little success didn't come by just change. But rather by the chances I have taken."
3. "I believed in myself when no one else did - not even my family or the people I call friends. So my honest answer to you is believe in yourself, your dream or goal. Believe so much that it is enough to carry you through."
4. "Saying I'm going to be this or one day I'm going to do that, is cute and all. But actually putting in the work, taking action and consistently grinding - well that's beauty!"
5. "I have failed so many times and played small for the longest time. The moment I developed myself, my state of mind shifted. I wanted to know what will it be like to succeed. I wanted to know what it feels like to play big."
6. "The road to success is neither comfortable of convenient, but what ever you do don't let anything derail you."
7. "Look unless you dead, it's just a knockout. You can walk it off, heal, plan a new strategy and get back to fighting. You just have to keep fighting!"
