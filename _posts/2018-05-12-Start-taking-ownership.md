# Start taking ownership

> People aren’t starting. They’re not making, they’re thinking, they’re pondering, they’re strategizing, they’re debating. – Gary
Vaynerchuk


I had a conversation with a few of my childhood friends and
something about that really pissed me off. We were talking about soccer, in particular, making a career of the sport.


They kept emphasizing on the fact that South African Soccer
is a dead end, and that your chances of recognition are near impossible, and even if you did make it in S.A you wouldn’t stand a chance on the world scale. That to me is one hundred percent truth… _if you believe it._


When we critically analysed their days we came to realise
they doing enough stupid shit to jeopardise their dreams. They sleep late and wake up even later, they smoke hookah and drink on weekends and most times miss training sessions with the team.


 Their response to this was that even if they did put in the work it wouldn’t matter because scouts don’t notice them. They always over looked and never get the fair opportunities other players get at trials. 


How will scouts notice you when you aren’t worth noticing?
How will people believe in you when you don’t believe in yourself? How will you achieve greatness when you not putting in great deal of effort?

 We as a society want to be the best, we want the fame and fortune but we don’t put in the work. Even when we do put in the work we want instant gratification. Guess what? It’s never that easy. Sylvester Stallone struggled to make ends meet as an actor, even resorted to porn films to scrap by. Only at the age of 30 was he casted as Rocky.

I could go on and on about the struggles successful people
faced but none of that matters. What does matter is that they persevered, they believed in themselves and most of all they put in the work. *Now why the hell aren't you doing the same?*

I hope from this you understand that what you put in you get out.
Most importantly remember, sacrifice comes before success even in the dictionary. 

Till next time
